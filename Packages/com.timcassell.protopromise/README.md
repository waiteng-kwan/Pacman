Robust and efficient library for management of asynchronous operations.

- Allocation-free async operations
- Cancelable operations with custom allocation-free CancelationToken/Source
- Allocation-free async iterators with async Linq
- Progress with enforced normalization
- Structured concurrency
- async/await support and .Then API
- Thread safe
- Easily switch to foreground or background context
- Circular await detection
- Full causality traces
- Interoperable with Tasks and Unity's Coroutines/Awaitables
- CLS compliant

ProtoPromise conforms to the [Promises/A+ Spec](https://promisesaplus.com/) as far as is possible with C# (using static typing instead of dynamic), and further extends it to support Cancelations and Progress.

This library was built to work in all C#/.Net ecosystems, including Unity, Mono, .Net Framework, .Net Core, and AOT compilation. It is CLS compliant, so it is not restricted to only C#, and will work with any .Net language.

- ProtoPromise v3 supports .Net Standard 2.0 or newer (Unity 2018.3 or newer).
- ProtoPromise v2 supports .Net 3.5 or newer (Unity 5.5 or newer).

See [Guides](https://github.com/timcassell/ProtoPromise/tree/master/Docs/Guides) for information on how to install and use this library.
